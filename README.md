### About The Build

MarketPlace3.0 is a Web3 marketplace of the Metaverse which is powered by ThirdWeb. 

## Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Next.js is a React Production Framework which gives the best developer experience with all the features for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed. By using Next. js, we're able to do things like server-side rendering, which means the server reads through code and tells the browser what to display on the page. Server-side rendering creates faster, more versatile web applications

## How To Start

### Start with a pre-made Starter Template

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
